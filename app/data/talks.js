And naturally, the opposing mental models each have their benefits and tradeoffs — so how do you pick? While the choice is somewhat subjective, we'll discuss a few objective factors to consider.

In this talk I’ll go into some of the problems with the current workflow and why I think the existing solutions are bad. I’ll also demonstrate a component based visualization tool, a new markup language, and compiler which can generate React components, as possible solutions. My ultimate goal is to allow designers to build and deploy complex UI components from concept to production like they do with many other assets like video, images and icons.',

    summary: 'Last year I won the diversity scholarship and this year I’m going to talk about how we can grow this community outside of our peers. I’m going to talk about the importance of diversity within the tech culture and how doing that has brought React to be as awesome as it is. Also steps we can do to improve contributing, ideas of how we can collaborate, and how we can continue to develop a environment where React can be easier for people who are intimidated to learn it.',

    summary: "All editors format code slightly differently and don't even help with more complex situations like deeply indented syntax, which forces you to manually break it up across lines. This becomes a point of strife within teams, and we waste so much time trying to enforce a consistent coding style. I will show how a new JavaScript formatter, Prettier, takes a different approach and solves this problem completely, freeing you from the burden of thinking about code structure.",
