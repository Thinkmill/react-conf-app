Starting by looking at the internals of React Native debugging, we will take advantage of Node's built in Time Travel Debugging feature to jump back and forth between React Native call stacks. We will then leverage React Native's unique event model to mirror user gestures across multiple devices and use it to simultaneously test our app across various form factors. Once the app is written, we will set up an automated continuous deployment pipeline to quickly build, test and distribute our app, powered by Code Push and Visual Studio Mobile Center. In each of these cases, we will see why React Native is uniquely positioned to supercharge your mobile application development experience.",
